Exploding kittens is a simple card-game for 2 to 4 players (https://www.explodingkittens.com/pages/rules-kittens). Players start 
with a hand of cards, and take turns drawing and playing cards with different effects. If you draw an exploding kitten and are 
unable to defuse it then you explode and lose. If you donâ€™t explode, you win.
